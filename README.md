# Shiny for CHAPTER study

This repository contains all the code of the shiny application for the CHAPTER study. 
This code works on the aggregated incidence results outputted by the analysis in 
[this link](https://github.com/dr-you-group/CHAPTER/tree/devKim).
To run this code, you need incidence and characterisation results in the format
yielded by the main analysis code inside a folder called 'data'.
